# Contributing
Contributions needed are mostly images. We currently only accept fanart and screenshots from the anime. We also do not accept GIFs at the moment, but this will change in the future.

## Important info
The following large image sources are mostly added into the image database, so you shouldn't add them, as it would cause in lots of duplicates

## 1. Forking the repo
Check out [this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) guide to learn how to fork the repository.

## 2. Add your images
Go to the folder (img_original for anime screenshots or img_fanart for fanart) and open the JSON file of your character. If your character does not exist, request it by contacting CRUGG#0001 on Discord or emailing ich@crugg.de
To add the image to the JSON file you just need to copy the section between and including the "{" and "}" from another entry and change the values. For URL add a **direct** link to the image (For fanarts from Pixiv please re-upload them on a service like imgur). For Source enter the name of Fanart Artist and the platform it was published on (e.g. Pixiv) or for Screenshot to the website you got it from or to yourself if you did the screenshot yourself.
Please also make sure that after every element between the "{" and "}" there has to be a comma. This does not apply to the last one. After the last one there has to be no comma.
